    (a) calc(23.4, 55.1) is illegal because the declaration says that the function expects
        1 double, but we are calling it with 2. 
        
    (b) count("abcda", 'a') is legal.
    
    
    (c) calc(66) is legal.
    
    (d) sum(vec.begin(), vec.end(), 3.8) is illegal because the third argument to the
        function needs to be an int, not a double.
